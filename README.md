# PrivEsc_AddUser.go

A small programm written in Go that creates a new user account and adds it to the group of administrative users.
I will first try to write a windows version and then maybe add Linux / Mac OS code of possible.

## Disclaimer

This is one of my first Go projects and mostly aimed at teaching myself the basics of the language (and maybe some slightly mode advanced stuff like platform specific code, size optimisation, obfiscation etc).
Please do not expect a properly maintained, bug free code base ;)
